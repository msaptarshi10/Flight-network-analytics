# Flight-network-analytics

***Air transportation is a vital global system connecting people and goods. Analyzing this complex network through network analysis is essential. This project uses a U.S. flight dataset and the networkx Python library to uncover insights like busy airports, flight paths, and nearby airports. It aims to improve efficiency, sustainability, and decision-making in aviation, impacting various sectors. Ultimately, it enhances global accessibility and trade while fostering cultural exchange and understanding.***
